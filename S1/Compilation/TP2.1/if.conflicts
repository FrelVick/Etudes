** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 8.
** Token involved: SEMI
** This state is reached from prog after reading:

IF COND seq ELSE seq 

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

prog 
seq EOF

** In state 8, looking ahead at SEMI, reducing production
** expr -> IF COND seq ELSE seq 
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

seq SEMI expr // lookahead token appears
expr // lookahead token is inherited
IF COND seq ELSE seq . 

** In state 8, looking ahead at SEMI, shifting is permitted
** because of the following sub-derivation:

expr 
IF COND seq ELSE seq 
                 seq . SEMI expr 

** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 4.
** Tokens involved: SEMI ELSE
** The following explanations concentrate on token SEMI.
